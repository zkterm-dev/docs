## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is zkTerm?">
    zkTerm is a universal zero-knowledge terminal that unifies the entire ZK ecosystem. It provides cryptographic primitives, identity solutions, file encryption, and blockchain compression in one CLI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is zkTerm free to use?">
    Yes! zkTerm is free to use. You only pay blockchain gas fees for on-chain operations (Solana/Starknet transactions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which blockchains does zkTerm support?">
    - Solana (mainnet & devnet)
    - Starknet (mainnet & sepolia)
    - Zcash (coming soon)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to install anything?">
    No installation required! Access the terminal at [zkterm.io/terminal](https://zkterm.io/terminal). For API integration, install npm packages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## zkID

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a zkID?">
    zkID is a privacy-preserving universal identity with format `did:zk:[12 chars]`. It uses Ed25519 cryptography and is verified on both Solana and Starknet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I recover my zkID if I forget my password?">
    No. zkID uses client-side encryption with no password recovery. Keep your credentials safe!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is zkID different from wallet addresses?">
    zkID is chain-agnostic and privacy-focused. It works across multiple blockchains without exposing transaction history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use one zkID across multiple applications?">
    Yes! zkID is designed for universal identity across all ZK-compatible applications.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## zkStorage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How secure is zkStorage?">
    Files are encrypted client-side with AES-256-GCM. Password verification uses Groth16 zkSNARKs. Files are stored on IPFS for decentralization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the maximum file size?">
    Current limit is 100MB per file due to IPFS gateway constraints.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete uploaded files?">
    Files on IPFS are permanent. You can unpin them from Pinata, but they may exist on other IPFS nodes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I share encrypted files?">
    Use `zk storage share <cid>` to generate a shareable link with embedded password (encrypted).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## zkCompression

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much can I save with compression?">
    Up to 1000x reduction in storage costs. Creating a compressed token account costs ~120k lamports vs ~2M lamports for standard SPL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are compressed tokens compatible with standard wallets?">
    Compressed tokens require Light Protocol-compatible wallets. Most standard wallets won't show compressed balances.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I decompress tokens back to standard SPL?">
    Yes! Use `decompress <mint> <amount>` to convert back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does compression affect token functionality?">
    No. Compressed tokens work exactly like standard SPL tokens but with massively reduced storage costs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## zkToolkit

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What cryptographic primitives are available?">
    10 modules: hash, commit, merkle, range, sign, nullifier, field, ec, shamir, proof. See [zkToolkit docs](/zk-ecosystem/zktoolkit).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use zkToolkit in production?">
    Yes! All primitives use battle-tested libraries (circomlibjs, snarkjs) and are production-ready.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fast is proof generation?">
    Groth16 proofs take ~5-10 seconds. STARK proofs take ~2-5 seconds. Ed25519 signatures are near-instant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create custom ZK circuits?">
    Yes! You can write custom circom circuits and use zkTerm's proof generation infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What ZK proof systems does zkTerm use?">
    - Groth16 for zkStorage password verification
    - STARK for zkID on Starknet
    - Ed25519 for digital signatures
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are proofs verified on-chain?">
    Solana: Direct Ed25519 signature verification
    Starknet: Cairo smart contract verifies STARK proofs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I audit the smart contracts?">
    Yes! Contracts are open source:
    - Starknet: `contracts/starknet/src/lib.cairo`
    - GitHub: github.com/zkterm
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the tech stack?">
    - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, XTerm
    - Backend: Express.js, PostgreSQL
    - Blockchain: Solana, Starknet
    - ZK: circomlibjs, snarkjs, starknet.js
  </Accordion>
